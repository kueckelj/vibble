\title{Add a masking layer}
\usage{
layer_mask(color, opacity = 0.25, .cond = NULL, .by = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{color}{Color used for the mask fill.}

\item{opacity}{Controls voxel transparency. Accepts constants, ranges, or
data-masked expressions. See \link[=vbl_doc_opacity]{Details}.}

\item{.cond}{A logical filter expression that determines the specific
voxels for which this layer is drawn. The expression is evaluated via
\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking} semantics with the 2D vibble passed
into this layer by \code{ggplane}(). See \link[=vbl_doc_cond]{Details}.}

\item{.by}{A \link[dplyr:dplyr_tidy_select]{tidy-selection} of columns to
group by before applying the filtering logic of \code{.cond}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggvibble_layer} object containing the supplied function. When
added to a \code{ggvibble}, the function is executed and its returned layers are
inserted into the plot.
}
\description{
Overlay a logical mask on a \link{ggplane}() plot by filling
voxels.
}
\details{
The condition of \code{.cond} determines for which voxels are included in the mask.
If no condition is provided (\code{.cond = NULL}) this layer masks every voxel in
every slice of the 2D vibble passed to this layer by \code{ggplane()}.
