\title{Add ggplot2 components via a ggvibble layer}
\usage{
layer_misc(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{ggplot2 objects such as themes, annotations, scales, or coordinates.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggvibble_layer} object containing the supplied function. When
added to a \code{ggvibble}, the function is executed and its returned layers are
inserted into the plot.
}
\description{
Collects ggplot2 objects supplied via \code{...} and injects them into the ggvibble
plotting pipeline as a single ggvibble layer.
}
\details{
\code{layer_misc()} provides a controlled interoperability mechanism with ggplot2.
Objects passed via \code{...} are filtered to ggplot-compatible objects (class
containing \code{"gg"}) and added during plot materialization.

This avoids direct use of \code{+} with ggplot2 components, which can lead to
ambiguous operator dispatch.
}
\note{
\code{gg} objects that inherit \emph{'Facet'} are not allowed and discarded.
}
