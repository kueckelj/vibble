\title{Add or reconstruct voxel IDs based on spatial coordinates}
\usage{
id_add(vbl, arrange = TRUE, rm_coords = FALSE)

id_split(vbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{vbl}{A \link{vibble}.}

\item{arrange}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, rows are arranged by the newly created \code{id}.}

\item{rm_coords}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, remove the original coordinate columns after creating the ID.}
}
\value{
For \code{id_add()}: A tibble with a new integer column \code{id}.
For \code{id_split()}: A tibble in which \code{id} has been split back into \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{z}.
}
\description{
Create a unique integer voxel identifier from zero-padded \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z} coordinates or reconstruct spatial coordinates from such an ID. These helpers provide a reversible mapping between 3D voxel positions and a single integer key.
}
\details{
The width of each coordinate block is defined by the maximum observed coordinate
in the respective axis using \link{ccs_limits}(). Zero-padding ensures fixed-width
encoding, enabling safe concatenation and later reversal.

\code{id_add()}:
\itemize{
\item Pads \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z} to fixed widths.
\item Concatenates them into a single string.
\item Converts the result to an integer \code{id}.
}

\code{id_split()}:
\itemize{
\item Verifies that \code{id} has the expected padded length.
\item Splits the ID into fixed-width substrings.
\item Converts each back into integer coordinates.
}

These functions provide a deterministic and reversible mapping useful for joins, indexing, hashing, and storage of voxel-based data.
}
\note{
IDs are not required for standard operations because each voxel is already uniquely
identified by its \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z} coordinates. The integer ID is only a
convenience key and becomes useful when transferring information between
a \link{vibble} and its corresponding \link{vibble2D}, storing intermediate results,
or performing joins that benefit from a single-column identifier.

An integer ID column as created with zero-padding has the advantage of more
efficient storage usage. See examples.
