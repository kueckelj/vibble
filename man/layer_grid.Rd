\title{Add grid lines to a ggvibble plot}
\usage{
layer_grid(
  col = 0.1,
  row = 0.1,
  alpha = 0.25,
  color = "lightgrey",
  linewidth = 0.5,
  linetype = "solid"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{col, row}{Numeric or \code{NULL}. Controls vertical grid lines:
\itemize{
\item \code{length(col) > 1}: values are used directly as x-intercepts.
\item \code{length(col) == 1} and \code{col < 1}: interpreted as a proportion of
the maximal \code{col} limit. Grid lines are placed symmetrically around the
center (half the maximum) with that spacing.
\item \code{length(col) == 1} and \code{col >= 1}: interpreted as an absolute
spacing in coordinate units, again used to place symmetric lines around
the center.
\item \code{NULL} or length 0: no vertical grid lines are drawn.
}}

\item{alpha, line_color, linewidth, linetype}{Aesthetic settings for grid appearance.
Each can be supplied either as a single value or as a vector of length 2:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Length 1}: The value is applied to both axes (vertical and
horizontal grid lines).

\item \strong{Length 2}: The first element is applied to vertical grid
lines (controlled by \code{col}) and the second element to horizontal grid
lines (controlled by \code{row}).
}

Input specifics:
\itemize{
\item \strong{alpha}: Numeric transparency in \verb{[0,1]}.
\item \strong{color}: Any valid color specification.
\item \strong{linewidth}: Positive numeric line width.
\item \strong{linetype}: Any valid line type (e.g., \code{"solid"}, \code{"dashed"}).
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggvibble_layer} object containing the supplied function. When
added to a \code{ggvibble}, the function is executed and its returned layers are
inserted into the plot.
}
\description{
Draw vertical and/or horizontal grid lines at regular positions
across slices of a \code{vbl2D} object.
}
\details{
\code{layer_grid()} computes grid-line positions using \link{grid_intercepts}()
based on the \code{col} and \code{row} settings and the coordinate limits stored in
\code{var_smr}. For each slice, vertical lines are created via \link{geom_vline}()
and horizontal lines via \link{geom_hline}(), using axis-specific aesthetics
derived from \code{alpha}, \code{color}, \code{linewidth}, and \code{linetype}.

This layer is primarily intended for visual guidance and debugging and can
be combined with numeric, mask, or label layers in the \code{ggplane()} framework.
