\title{Add grid lines to a ggvibble plot}
\usage{
layer_grid(
  col = 0.1,
  row = 0.1,
  alpha = 0.15,
  color = "lightgrey",
  linewidth = 0.25,
  linetype = "solid"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{Numeric or \code{NULL}. Controls vertical grid lines:
\itemize{
\item \code{length(col) > 1}: values are used directly as col-intercepts.
\item \code{length(col) == 1} and \code{col < 1}: interpreted as a proportion of
the maximal \code{col} limit. Grid lines are placed symmetrically around the
center (half the maximum) with that spacing.
\item \code{length(col) == 1} and \code{col >= 1}: interpreted as an absolute
spacing in coordinate units, again used to place symmetric lines around
the center.
\item \code{NULL} or length 0: no vertical grid lines are drawn.
}}

\item{row}{Numeric or \code{NULL}. Controls horizontal grid lines. See \code{col} for
details.}

\item{alpha, color, linewidth, linetype}{\link[=vbl_doc_plot_aesthetics]{Aesthetic settings}
for grid appearance. Each can be supplied either as a single value or as a vector of
length 2:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Length 1}: The value is applied to both axes (vertical and
horizontal grid lines).
\item \strong{Length 2}: The first element is applied to vertical grid
lines and the second element to horizontal grid lines.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggvibble_layer} object containing the supplied function. When
added to a \code{ggvibble}, the function is executed and its returned layers are
inserted into the plot.
}
\description{
Draw vertical and/or horizontal grid lines at regular positions
across slices of a \code{vbl2D} object.
