\title{Variables for 3D spatial representation}
\description{
Spatial 3D variables represent immutable voxel coordinates in a 3D Cartesian
grid and form the structural backbone of every vibble. They uniquely identify
each voxel and ensure that all operations preserve anatomical alignment and
positional consistency across volumes.
}
\section{Concept}{

Spatial 3D variables encode the fixed index-space coordinates of the volume.
They correspond to the mandatory vibble columns \code{x}, \code{y}, and
\code{z} and are implemented through the \code{vbl_spat3D} vctrs class.
Their values must remain unchanged throughout all data transformations.
}

\section{Backing type}{

\itemize{
\item Integer vector.
}
}

\section{Behaviour}{

\itemize{
\item Immutable: arithmetic operations are disallowed.
\item Only subsetting and comparisons are permitted.
\item In vibbles, the \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{z} columns cannot be
renamed, removed, or overwritten.
}
}

\section{Required attributes}{

\itemize{
\item \code{axis}: One of \code{"x"}, \code{"y"}, or \code{"z"} identifying
the axis represented by the variable.
\item \code{limits}: Integer vector \code{c(1L, dim_axis)} specifying the
full coordinate range for this axis.
\item \code{pointer}: Anatomical direction towards which the index increases,
such as \code{"L"} (left), \code{"I"} (inferior), or \code{"P"} (posterior).
\item \code{step_si}: Physical spacing (in millimetres) per index step,
derived from NIfTI header information.
}
}

\section{Derived coordinate space}{

The physical (“world-space”) coordinate for a Spatial 3D variable can be
obtained via \link{in_mm}(), which returns values in millimetres as a
standard double vector. These derived vectors may be used freely for
arithmetic and visualisation without affecting the immutable index-space
coordinates.
