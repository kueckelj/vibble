layer_slice_number(
  anchor,
  space = "avg",
  align = NULL,
  wrap = NULL,
  angle = 0,
  alpha = 0.8,
  color = "white",
  size = 3.5,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{anchor}{Character or numeric anchor specification defining the relative
position of labels within each slice's bounding box. See
\code{\link{img_anchors}} for valid presets.}

\item{space}{One of \code{"slice"}, \code{"screen"}, or \code{"avg"}, indicating
which 2D limit should define the anchor position:
\itemize{
\item \code{"slice"} – use raw slice limits.
\item \code{"screen"} – use screen-space limits (after offsets).
\item \code{"avg"} – use the average of slice and screen limits.
}}

\item{align}{Optional. If \code{"col"} or \code{"row"}, enforce alignment of
label positions across slices along the chosen axis.}

\item{wrap}{Optional template for label text. Defaults to \code{"{slice}"}.}

\item{angle}{Rotation angle passed to \code{geom_text()}.}

\item{alpha, color, size}{Passed to \code{geom_text()} to define the label aesthetics.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{geom_text()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggvibble_layer} object containing the supplied function. When
added to a \code{ggvibble}, the function is executed and its returned layers are
inserted into the plot.
}
\description{
Add slice numbers as text labels to a 2D vibble (\code{vbl2D}). Labels are
positioned using an anchor specification and can be computed relative to
slice limits, screen limits, or their average. Optional alignment ensures
consistent label placement across slices.
}
\details{
Anchor coordinates may be supplied either as preset strings (e.g.
\code{"top-right"}) or as relative coordinates in \eqn{[0,1]^2}. For each
slice, the chosen limit specification (\code{to}) determines the bounding box
in which the anchor is resolved. If \code{align} is used, the selected axis
(\code{col} or \code{row}) is harmonized across all slices.
