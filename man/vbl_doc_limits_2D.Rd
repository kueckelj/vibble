\usage{
data_bb(vbl2D, slice = NULL)

plot_bb(vbl2D)

screen_bb(vbl2D, slice = NULL)

slice_bb(vbl2D, slice)
}
\arguments{
\item{vbl2D}{A \link[=vbl_doc_vbl2D]{2D vibble}.}

\item{slice}{Integer slice value.}
}
\description{
This documentation defines the different \code{bb2D} limit concepts used in
vibble 2D plotting workflows. 2D limits are used to crop data, to define the
visible plotting area, and to anchor annotations consistently across slices,
including offset layouts.
}
\details{
Each function returns \link[=is_bb2D]{2D bounding box} objects that correspond to specific extents:

\itemize{

\item{\code{slice_bb()}: }{ Per-slice extent in native coordinates.
Defined by \code{range(col)} and \code{range(row)} computed within each slice. Useful
for slice-local annotations (e.g. label placement at slice centroid) and
for diagnostics of slice coverage.}

\item{\code{data_bb()}: }{ Global extent of the voxel data across all selected slices in
native coordinates. Defined by \code{range(col)} and \code{range(row)} computed over
all slices in the 2D vibble. Useful as a stable, data-driven
reference window when no explicit limits are provided.

In offset-layouts, \code{slice} can be used to get the data bounding box of a specific
slice post-offset. If \code{NULL} in this case, the first slice is used.
}

\item{\code{screen_bb()}: }{ A single common bounding box applied to all slices in
native coordinates. This is the user-imposed viewing window, typically derived
from \code{bb} plus \code{expand} in \link{vibble2D}(). Useful to anchor annotations at consistent screen
positions across slices (e.g. always place a legend label at the top-left of the same window).

In offset-layouts, \code{slice} can be used to get the screen bounding box of a specific
slice post-offset. If \code{NULL} in this case, the first slice is used.
}

\item{\code{plot_bb()}: }{ The final bounding box in plotting (post-offset)
coordinates. Defined as the union of all translated \code{screen_bb()} after
applying per-slice offsets. Useful to compute global annotation positions
for the complete composite layout and to ensure all offset slices remain
within the visible plotting area.}
}

In no-offset layouts, \code{plot_bb()} and \code{screen_bb()} are identical because
all slices share the same coordinate frame.
