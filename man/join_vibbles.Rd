\title{Join two vibbles by spatial coordinates}
\usage{
join_vibbles(a, b, .rfn = NULL, join = "full", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{a, b}{\code{vbl} objects to be joined. Their \code{ccs_limits} must match exactly.}

\item{.rfn}{Optional renaming function or formula applied to all non-coordinate
variables of \code{b} before joining (e.g., \code{~ paste0(.x, "_b")}).}

\item{join}{Type of join to perform. One of \code{"full"}, \code{"inner"}, \code{"left"},
or \code{"right"}. Determines how voxel coordinates absent in one input are treated.}

\item{...}{Reserved for future extensions.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing all coordinate columns and the combined voxelwise
variables from both inputs, according to the selected join strategy.
}
\description{
Joins two \code{vbl} objects of the same reference space by their Cartesian coordinate
columns (\code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z}).
}
\details{
The join is performed strictly on the three spatial coordinate columns
(\code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z}). Before joining, overlapping variable names between \code{a} and \code{b}
(excluding the coordinate columns) are prohibited unless \code{.rfn} is used to
disambiguate them. This prevents silent overwriting of voxelwise variables.

Matching \code{ccs_limits} between the two vibbles is required to ensure that both
objects reside in the same voxel grid and share a valid spatial reference
system. If the limits differ, the function aborts with an informative error.
