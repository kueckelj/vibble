\title{Expand limits of a 2D bounding box}
\usage{
expand_bb2D(bb2D, expand)
}
\arguments{
\item{bb2D}{A named list that defines a \link[=is_bb2D]{2D bounding box} with \link[=is_limit]{limits} for col and row.}

\item{expand}{An \link[=is_expand]{expand} specification that determines how
the bounding box is expanded (absolute, relative, or logical).}
}
\value{
A modified \code{bb2D} object with updated limits for \code{col} and \code{row}.
}
\description{
Expand a 2D bounding box (\code{bb2D}) according to an absolute, relative,
or logical \link[=vbl_doc_expand]{expand rule}. This operation adjusts the
lower and upper limits of both \code{col} and \code{row} while preserving the
structure of the bounding box.
}
\examples{
vbl2D <- vibble2D(example_vbl(), plane = "axi", slices = 60)
bb <- slice_bbox(vbl2D, slice = 60)

# Absolute expansion: add 2 units on each side
expand_bb2D(bb, 2L)

# Relative expansion: expand by 10\% of the current range
expand_bb2D(bb, 0.1)
