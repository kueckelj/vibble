\title{Variables in the vibble package}
\description{
Vibble variables are organised into three major groups based on their role
within a voxel-level tidy-data structure: Spatial 3D variables, Spatial 2D
variables, and Data variables. Each group corresponds to a distinct semantic
layer in the vibble framework and is implemented through dedicated vctrs
classes. The sections below outline the conceptual purpose of each group and
link to the respective detailed documentation.
}
\section{Spatial 3D}{

Spatial 3D variables represent immutable voxel coordinates in the original
3D Cartesian index space of the volume. They define voxel identity and ensure
spatial alignment across all operations.
See \link{vbl_doc_var_spatial3D} for detailed specification of the
\code{vbl_spat3D} class.
}

\section{Spatial 2D}{

Spatial 2D variables represent slice-level or layout-level coordinates used
when projecting 3D data onto 2D planes. They include screen-space positions
for visualisation as well as slice indices that reference anatomical planes.
See \link{vbl_doc_var_spatial2D} for details on \code{vbl_screen} and
\code{vbl_slice}.
}

\section{Data variables}{

Data variables encode voxel-wise measurements such as categorical labels,
binary masks, and continuous numeric values. They use specialised vctrs
classes to retain plotting metadata (colour palettes, limits) while
preserving natural R behaviour for factors, logicals, and numerics.
See \link{vbl_doc_var_data} for detailed information on
\code{vbl_labels}, \code{vbl_mask}, and \code{vbl_num}.
