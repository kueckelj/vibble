\title{Variables for 2D spatial representation}
\description{
Spatial 2D variables represent slice-level and layout-level coordinates used
when projecting 3D voxel data onto 2D planes. They provide the positional
framework for arranging voxels in panel displays and for identifying the
anatomical slice and plane from which a 2D vibble is derived.
}
\section{Concept}{

Spatial 2D variables come in two forms:

\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{vbl_screen}}: 2D screen or panel coordinates used to
arrange voxels within a single slice image (e.g. \code{col} and \code{row}).

\item \strong{\code{vbl_slice}}: Discrete slice indices specifying the
anatomical plane from which the 2D representation originates (e.g.
sagittal, axial, coronal).
}

Both types carry a \code{plane} attribute that encodes the anatomical plane
(\code{"sag"}, \code{"axi"}, or \code{"cor"}) of the 2D representation.
}

\section{vbl_screen}{


\subsection{Concept}{
2D screen or panel coordinates used to arrange voxels within a slice-level
visualisation. They provide an integer grid layout (e.g. \code{col} and
\code{row}) for rasterised 2D representations.
}

\subsection{Backing type}{
Integer vector.
}

\subsection{Behaviour}{
\itemize{
\item Supports arithmetic operations (\code{+}, \code{-}, \code{*}, \code{/})
intended for layout construction (offsets, simple scaling, flipping).

\item Results of any arithmetic operation are automatically truncated
to integer values to ensure that screen coordinates always remain valid
grid indices for raster display.

\item Operations that produce non-finite values (\code{NA}, \code{Inf},
\code{NaN}) are not allowed.

\item Represents 2D arrangement only; anatomical meaning is derived via
the \code{plane} and \code{pointer} attributes inherited from the
underlying Spatial 3D axes.

\item Supports subsetting and comparisons.
}
}

\subsection{Required attributes}{
\itemize{
\item \code{axis2D}: \code{"col"} or \code{"row"}.

\item \code{plane}: Anatomical plane labels, one of \code{"sag"},
\code{"axi"}, or \code{"cor"}, indicating which 3D plane this 2D view
represents.

\item \code{limits}: Integer vector giving the nominal grid range for the
2D layout; may change when layout recalculations occur.

\item \code{pointer}: Anatomical direction towards which the index
increases within the 2D plane (inherited from the corresponding
\code{vbl_spat3D} axis).

\item \code{step_si}: Physical spacing in millimetres per index step
along this 2D axis, inherited from the relevant \code{vbl_spat3D} variable.
}
}
}

\section{vbl_slice}{


\subsection{Concept}{
Discrete slice indices identifying the anatomical slice from which a 2D
representation is derived. A \code{vbl_slice} variable specifies the position
of each voxel within an ordered stack of slices orthogonal to a 3D axis.
}

\subsection{Backing type}{
Integer vector.
}

\subsection{Behaviour}{
\itemize{
\item Arithmetic operations are not supported; slice indices define fixed
anatomical positions and must not be shifted or rescaled.

\item Valid operations include filtering, grouping, and comparisons.

\item Slice indices express ordinal progression along the axis orthogonal
to the 2D plane and thus retain anatomical meaning (e.g. left→right for
sagittal slices, superior→inferior for axial slices).

\item \code{vbl_slice} does not encode physical spacing; spacing in
millimetres is defined by the corresponding \code{vbl_spat3D} axis and is
not stored here.
}
}

\subsection{Required attributes}{
\itemize{
\item \code{plane}: Anatomical plane labels, one of \code{"sag"},
\code{"axi"}, or \code{"cor"}, indicating the orientation of the slice
stack.

\item \code{limits}: Integer vector \code{c(min_slice, max_slice)}
representing the full slice index range along the axis orthogonal to the
displayed plane.

\item \code{pointer}: Anatomical direction towards which the slice index
increases (e.g. moving posteriorly in an axial stack).
