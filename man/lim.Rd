\title{Limits utilities for 2D vibbles}
\usage{
lim(vbl2D)

lim(vbl2D) <- value

lim_plot(vbl2D)

lim_slice(vbl2D, slice)
}
\arguments{
\item{vbl2D}{A \link{vibble2D}.}

\item{value}{For \verb{lim<-()}, a 2D bounding box object as validated by
\code{is_bb2D()}. Typically a list with components \code{col} and \code{row}.}

\item{slice}{Integer scalar. For \code{lim_slice()}, the slice index for
which the 2D limits should be returned.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{lim()}: The stored 2D limits of a \code{vbl2D} object.
\item \code{lim<-()}: The modified \code{vbl2D} object with updated limits.
\item \code{lim_plot()}: A 2D limits object adapted for plotting, taking
offsets into account across all slices.
\item \code{lim_slice()}: A 2D limits object for a single slice, adapted
for the slice-specific offset position.
}
}
\description{
Accesses and manipulates 2D limits for \code{vbl2D} objects. These limits define
the bounding box of the space in \code{col}/\code{row} coordinates used for plotting.
}
\details{
The \code{lim()} accessor and its replacement form operate on the 2D limits
stored in the \code{lim} attribute of a \code{vbl2D} object. These limits describe the
visible extent in \code{col}/\code{row} coordinates and may be changed to crop or
expand the displayed region in 2D.

The 3D coordinate system limits (\code{ccs_limits}) of the original 3D vibble are not
affected by these functions and remain the primary identifiers of space and voxels for
merging and alignment purposes!

\subsection{Offset handling}{
\itemize{
\item \code{lim_plot()} returns limits adjusted for the cumulative offset
applied when slices are staggered using \code{offset_dist} and \code{offset_dir}.
This is typically used internally when computing plotting ranges.
\item \code{lim_slice()} returns limits for a single slice. If the
\code{vbl2D} object is offset, the limits are shifted according to the slice
index so that they match the displayed position of that slice.
