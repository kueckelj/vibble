\title{Plotting layouts}
\description{
This documentation defines the two layout modes used to display multiple
slices in \code{ggplane()}: no-offset layouts and offset layouts.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item{No-offset layout: }{ Used when \code{offset_col = 0} and \code{offset_row = 0}.
Each slice is displayed in its own panel using \code{facet_wrap()}. Slices do not
share a coordinate system, so slices cannot overlap visually.}

\item{Offset layout: }{ Used when either \code{offset_col} or \code{offset_row} is
non-zero. All slices are translated into a shared plotting space by applying
slice-wise offsets, so multiple slices can be displayed together without
faceting. Slices may overlap; in overlaps, the stacking order is controlled
by \code{zstack} (ascending or descending slice order). Global plot bounds are
derived from the union of translated \code{screen_bb} windows (\code{plot_bb}). This
layout enables annotations anchored to the full composite layout (e.g.
top-left of \code{plot_bb}) and consistent screen-relative placement across the
entire offset arrangement.}
}

See \code{vbl_doc_limits_2D} for definitions of \code{data_bb}, \code{screen_bb}, and
\code{plot_bb} as they relate to layout and annotation anchoring.
