\title{Operators in the ggvibble framework}
\usage{
\method{Ops}{ggvibble}(x, y)
}
\description{
Defines how \code{ggvibble} objects behave with the operators \code{+}, \code{/}, and \code{|}.
}
\details{
The \code{ggvibble} plotting framework is a deferred plotting pipeline that is
converted into a ggplot object only when needed. Operator support is therefore
limited to operations that can be implemented safely and unambiguously.

\itemize{
\item{\code{+} : } Adds a ggvibble layer to a ggvibble, or combines two ggvibbles
(requires patchwork to be attached).
\item{\code{/} : } Combines two ggvibbles vertically (requires patchwork to be attached).
\item{\code{|} : } Combines two ggvibbles horizontally (requires patchwork to be attached).
}
}
\section{Why direct integration with ggplot2 is not supported}{

ggplot2 uses S3 operator methods for \code{+} (e.g. \code{+.gg}). Many ggplot2 components
(themes, scales, coordinate systems) participate in this operator dispatch.
Adding such objects directly to a \code{ggvibble} via \code{+} can trigger ambiguous S3
dispatch and results in errors such as "Incompatible methods" or fallback to the
base numeric \code{+} operator.

For this reason, \code{ggvibble} \strong{does not support} adding ggplot2 components to a
\code{ggvibble} object directly with \code{+}. Instead, convert explicitly to ggplot, or
inject ggplot2 objects through \code{layer_misc()}.

\preformatted{
p <- ggvibble(vbl, var = "t1", plane = "axi", slices = 120)

# fails:
p + ggplot2::theme_void()

# preferred: convert explicitly and continue with ggplot2
as_ggplot(p) + ggplot2::theme_void()

# alternative: add ggplot2 objects through the ggvibble pipeline
p + layer_misc(ggplot2::theme_void())
}
}

\section{Patchwork composition}{

Combining ggvibbles with \code{+}, \code{/}, or \code{|} relies on patchwork composition.
Patchwork must be attached to enable plot composition.

\preformatted{
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggvibble(vbl, var = "t1", plane = "axi", slices = 120)
p2 <- ggvibble(vbl, var = "flair", plane = "axi", slices = 120)

# horizontal and vertical composition
p1 | p2
p1 / p2

# combining with `+` is also supported for ggvibble objects
p1 + p2
}
}

\section{Notes}{

\itemize{
\item{Operator scope: } Only \code{+}, \code{/}, and \code{|} are implemented for \code{ggvibble}.
\item{Layer addition: } \code{+} supports adding \code{ggvibble_layer} objects to a \code{ggvibble}.
\item{Composition: } Combining two \code{ggvibble} objects converts both to ggplot and
returns a patchwork object.
